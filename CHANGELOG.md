# Changelog

Dieter ships one version across the daemon/CLI, gateway and native clients.
Nightly dev prereleases (`v0.5.N`) list their pull requests on the GitHub
release. A stable release promotes one tested dev build; before you promote it,
copy the **Unreleased** notes into a section named after that exact version
(for example `## 0.5.412`). Promotion fails without that section.

## Unreleased

The open-source foundation release. It is a clean break: reinstall the daemon
and apps; nothing migrates from 0.4.

### Breaking

- **Identifiers.** Every app and helper moves to `com.getdieter.*`:
  - `com.getdieter.mac`, `com.getdieter.ios` and `com.getdieter.android`;
  - `com.getdieter.daemon`, `com.getdieter.capture` and `com.getdieter.privacy`.

  Android and macOS installs are new apps. Sign in again on every device, and
  re-register the macOS privacy helper (`dieter setup`).

- **Apple team.** Signed binaries, the privacy helper and the installer trust
  only team `FNGU8JFNPL`.
- **iOS sign-in** uses the `dieter-ios://` callback. The gateway must allow it
  (the deployment renders it).
- **Daemon API.** `dieter.v1` is one service per domain (`CardService`,
  `ConversationService`, `ScreenService`, …) instead of one `DieterService`.
  - RPC paths change, so clients, daemons and gateways below 0.5 cannot talk to
    0.5.
  - The gateway's minimum client and daemon version is `0.5.0-dev.0`.
- **Release signing.** Checksums and the gateway deployment bundle are signed
  only by `.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main`.
- **Removed.** The private OMP/Pi model routes (Tailscale GLM, Box Qwen) are
  gone from the default catalog.

### Changed

- **Repository layout.**
  - `apps/kotlin` is one Gradle build: core, Compose UI and the Android app.
  - `apps/apple` holds `DieterKit`, the Mac app and the iOS app.
  - `native/macos` is a SwiftPM package for the daemon helpers.
  - Vendored code moved to `third_party/`, the website to `site/`, and the
    gateway deployment files to `deploy/`.
- **Daemon.** The startup wiring moved out of the CLI into `internal/daemon`,
  with one configuration loader and per-domain API handlers.
  - Unknown server errors are reported as `Internal`, so clients retry them
    instead of dropping the command.
- **Schemas.** All `.proto` files live in `api/proto`. `just generate` runs buf
  for Go and Swift and fails CI on drift; Kotlin generates from the same files.
- **Builds.**
  - Fastlane builds, signs and distributes using its built-in actions.
  - The Mac app now has an Xcode project, built with `build_mac_app`.
  - Plain `go`, `gradlew` and `swift` commands work without Fastlane.
- **CI.**
  - Pull requests run only the affected checks, behind one required `ci-ok`
    check.
  - Failures show as annotations, every job writes a summary, and every test
    runner reports JUnit.
  - Dev releases are cut nightly, not on every push.

### Fixed

- **Installer.** It verified the old Apple team, so it rejected current
  releases.
- **Privacy helper.** It authorized clients signed by the old team only.
- **Local daemon on a random port.** `dieter serve --addr 127.0.0.1:0` now
  records the port it actually bound, so the CLI can reach it.
- **Fixture gateways.** They no longer reinstall the harness runtime for every
  test fixture.
